LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell tm10_instance/count[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) tm10_instance/count_reg[0]/CLR, tm10_instance/count_reg[1]/CLR,
tm10_instance/count_reg[2]/CLR, tm10_instance/count_reg[3]/CLR
tm10_instance/tm_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell tm15_instance/count[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) tm15_instance/count_reg[0]/CLR, tm15_instance/count_reg[1]/CLR,
tm15_instance/count_reg[2]/CLR, tm15_instance/count_reg[3]/CLR
tm15_instance/tm_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert

tm3_instance/tm_done_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btnC relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
